This project is about implement a neural network (NN) architecture from scratch. Building
the neural network will give hands-on experience converting mathematical foundations of NN
such as feed-forward and backpropagation algorithms into Python code. The project
includes the implementation of sub-functions in NN such as loss functions, activation
functions, and their derivatives. The project is divided into 3 phases:

Phase 1: Implement and test a baseline Neural Network
Phase 2: Integrate additional functionalities to the Neural Network model
Phase 3: Classify cancerous cells using Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset
